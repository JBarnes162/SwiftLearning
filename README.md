SwiftWorkspace

This will track my progress in learning and making the transition to Swift and iOS development

02.12.20: Feeling good about progress so far, I much prefer out looping and decision making is
done, I also prefer how much easier readibilty is within this code.

Especially making functions such as:

difference (between: Int and: Int)
or 
preview(message: String)

Enjoying it so far and looking forward to thinking about my first project, probably something console
based before moving onto an iOS app of some sorts.
